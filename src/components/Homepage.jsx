              <p>
                The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
                companies has allowed me to develop a skillset that helps me in
                not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the
                world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to
                sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world
                of opportunities.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                As a developer, you have everything available to you and all
                that's holding you back is yourself.
              </p>
              <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
              <p>
                "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've
                already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's
                time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something
                you're passionate about.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm happy to chat over coffee sometime about how I can help your
                company.
