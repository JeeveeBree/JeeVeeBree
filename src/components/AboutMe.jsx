          Outside of coding, I have a variety of hobbies that help fuel my
          creativity and keep me inspired. I’ve always been fascinated by bonsai
          – the delicate art of shaping and nurturing these miniature trees
          teaches me patience and precision, which I try to apply in my work as
          a developer. Gaming is another huge part of my life. I enjoy exploring
          new worlds and challenges in games, which also ties into my
          fascination with game development. Creating interactive and immersive
          experiences is something I’m really interested in and just started
          with my own projects in the Godot engine.

          In addition to tech, I’m also passionate about PC hardware. Lately,
          I’ve been diving deep into researching which components work best
          together to build a powerful new PC. I enjoy learning about the latest
          tech in the hardware space and am excited about putting together a
          custom build that will enhance my workflow and gaming experience.

          Aside from tech, I also play the guitar. Music has always been a
          creative outlet for me, first mostly listening and recently playing
          the guitar, which helps me unwind and express myself in a different
          way. I believe that a balance between tech and creativity makes life
          more fulfilling, and I always strive to bring that balance into my
          work.
