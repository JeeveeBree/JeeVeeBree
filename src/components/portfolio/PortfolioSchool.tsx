        The reasons for pursuing this education are numerous, and I’ll name a
        few. For instance, I like to learn — it’s the most obvious indicator for
        me that I’m moving forward. Which, of course, I like, as opposed to
        standing still. But I also like to learn because I enjoy knowing things,
        and I like to understand them better than I did before. Being
        knowledgeable is valuable; being able to explain things and help others
        is even better. I’d like to never stop learning.

        Another reason is a very obvious one: I simply find computers
        fascinating. How they work and what we are able to accomplish with them
        is sometimes awe-inspiring. For me, this applies not only to software
        but also to hardware. It’s amazing to think about how many computations
        a modern CPU can perform and how far we’ve come in the last 30 years.
        Growing up with this technology developing so quickly has been a treat
        to watch.

        There is also the aspect of developing (pun intended) my knowledge to
        gain a head start in the field I’m striving to be part of. That way,
        I’ll have a solid base to build and expand upon. And expand upon it I
        will, given the nature of computers and technology in general, with how
        fast everything evolves. There is, and always will be, a lot to learn.
